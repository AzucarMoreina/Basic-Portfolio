        <p> I was born and raised in Philadelphia, PA. At a young age I received an academic scholarship to attend a private boarding school, and so for much of my young adult life I lived away from home. Having grown up in the city and attending school out of state taught me the best of both worlds. I was street smart but also book smart.</p>
        <p> Currently I am in school wanting to create a career for myself in the technical field. Although I am a newbie I am driven by one of the most powerful sources, motherhood. Ultimately I wish to create a life where I am both present in my childs life and happy with my work/life balance.</p>
